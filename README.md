# CyberDesk: Behind the Network

**CyberDesk** is an interactive cybersecurity awareness game.  
You play the role of a hacker attempting to infiltrate a fictional financial company by chaining together realistic (but safe and simulated) cyberattacks.

---

## 🧠 Concept

This is a **pedagogical simulation** designed to raise awareness about common cybersecurity risks, from phishing to remote access exploitation.

---

## 🎬 Scenario

You’ve identified the **Chief Financial Officer** (CFO) of a major company as your target.  
She shared a **Facebook screenshot**, which revealed her Facebook email address.

Armed with that single clue, your mission is to **gain access to her company’s internal systems** and eventually reach her **personal smartphone**, where sensitive banking data is stored.

Your hacker toolkit is ready.  
Time to think like an attacker.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the logical flow of a multi-stage cyberattack
- Explore key concepts: phishing, brute-force, privilege escalation, pivoting, remote access
- Practice identifying and exploiting weaknesses — ethically

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a **modern browser** (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
3. Explore the virtual **hacker desktop**
4. Use the available tools in the right order — and think strategically

  
You’ll need to analyze, combine, and guess your next move like a real attacker.

## 🧩 Gameplay Hints (No Spoilers)

- Use what you know: a Facebook email might be more useful than you think
- A successful phishing attempt leads to a second, more valuable one
- Sometimes a leaked password gives limited access — explore deeper
- A backup can hide secrets... if you can unlock it
- The final step? Getting into the CFO’s phone
